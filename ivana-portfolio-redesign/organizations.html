      <p>As part of the logistics team, I helped organize and coordinate a humanitarian-themed quiz aimed at raising awareness and support for local humanitarian organization. My role involved planning event 
        logistics, managing materials and schedules, and ensuring smooth collaboration between teams.

        have fun, and make a positive impact through knowledge and community spirit.</p>
